New York State Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis

This project analyzes over 100,000 New York State motor vehicle collision records to identify trends, contributing factors, and relationships associated with crash frequency and vehicle damage. Using real-world public safety data, the analysis demonstrates end-to-end data analytics capabilities, including large-scale data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical reasoning, data visualization, and database integration using Python.

Raw collision data from New York State Open Data was cleaned and processed to improve reliability and usability. This included removing incomplete and invalid records, standardizing categorical variables, filtering irrelevant attributes, and restructuring the dataset for analysis. The final dataset contained a six-figure number of observations suitable for statistical analysis and visualization.

Exploratory data analysis was performed to evaluate collision frequency patterns and examine relationships between contributing factors and vehicle damage severity across thousands of records. Statistical summaries were used to support analytical findings, while more than 10 analytical visualizations were created using Matplotlib to clearly communicate trends and comparative relationships within the data.

To support scalability and reuse, the cleaned data was exported into a SQLite database, enabling efficient querying and reproducibility for future analysis or modeling. The project demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, and structured data storage within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Technologies used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite, and Jupyter Notebook. Future enhancements include geospatial collision analysis, regression modeling to predict crash severity, and expanding the dataset across multiple years to capture long-term trends
